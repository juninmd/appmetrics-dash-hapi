# AGENTS.md File Guidelines

These guidelines are designed to ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality development for all AI coding agents within this repository. Adherence to these principles is crucial for building a robust and scalable system.

## 1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

*   **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each agent should have a single, clearly defined purpose. Avoid creating agents with overlapping functionality.
*   **Code Reuse:** Promote the creation of reusable components and modules across multiple agents.
*   **Abstraction:**  Design agents with clear abstractions to hide internal complexity.  Avoid revealing implementation details.
*   **Documentation:**  Document all reusable components with clear explanations of their purpose, inputs, and outputs.

## 2. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

*   **Minimize Complexity:**  Strive for the simplest possible implementation that achieves the desired functionality.
*   **Readability:**  Prioritize code that is easily understood by other developers. Use meaningful variable and function names.
*   **Avoid Over-Engineering:**  Don’t introduce unnecessary complexity.  Refactor when clarity is lost.
*   **Focus on Core Logic:**  Ensure that the agent’s core logic is easily understandable and testable.

## 3. SOLID Principles

*   **Single Inheritance:**  Agents should be designed to be single inheritanceed to avoid tight coupling.
*   **Open/Closed Principle:**  Agents should be extensible without modifying their core functionality.  This is achieved through well-defined interfaces.
*   **Liskov Substitution Principle:**  Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the system.
*   **Interface Segregation Principle:**  Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
*   **Dependency Inversion Principle:**  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; they should depend on abstractions.

## 4. YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)

*   **Avoid Unnecessary Code:**  Do not add functionality that is not currently required.
*   **Refactoring:**  Refactor the code to eliminate unnecessary complexity and improve its structure.
*   **Prioritize Core Tasks:**  Focus on completing the essential tasks required by the agent’s core functionality.

## 5. Development Process & Best Practices

*   **Code Reviews:** All code should be reviewed by at least one other developer.
*   **Unit Testing:**  Each agent and module should have comprehensive unit tests to ensure correctness.
*   **Integration Testing:**  Thorough integration testing is crucial to verify interactions between agents.
*   **Documentation (Self-Documentation):**  Use docstrings to describe the purpose, inputs, and outputs of each agent. Provide clear comments where necessary.
*   **Versioning:**  Use a consistent versioning strategy (e.g., Semantic Versioning) for all agent files.
*   **Logging:** Implement logging to track agent behavior and errors.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
*   **Security Considerations:** All agent operations should be secure.

## 6. Code Size Limits

*   **Maximum Code Length:** Each file must be no more than 180 lines of code.
*   **Code Formatting:**  Strict code formatting rules should be enforced (e.g., using a linter).

## 7. Test Coverage Requirements

*   **Minimum Test Coverage:** 85% minimum test coverage is required for all agent files.
*   **Test Suite:** All agent files should have a well-defined test suite.

## 8.  File Structure & Organization

*   **Modular Design:**  Agents should be organized into modular components that are loosely coupled.
*   **Clear Naming Conventions:**  Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
*   **Comments:**  Adequate comments should be included to explain the intent of the code.

## 9.  Dependencies and External Libraries

*   **Explicit Dependencies:**  All external dependencies should be clearly documented and managed.
*   **Dependency Versioning:**  Use a consistent versioning strategy for external libraries.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Utilize a dependency management tool to track and update dependencies.

## 10.  AI Agent-Specific Considerations

*   **Prompt-Based Generation:** All code generation must be driven by detailed prompts.
*   **Output Validation:**  All output generated by the AI agent should be thoroughly validated.
*   **Error Analysis:**  Implement robust error analysis to identify and address potential issues.

These guidelines are intended to promote collaboration and maintain a high standard of quality across the entire AGENTS.  Continuous improvement and refinement of these practices are encouraged.
